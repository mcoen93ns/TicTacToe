Overview of atomic behaviors:
âœ” - Creating an empty board
    âœ” - Valid board: ['','','','','','','','','']

- Printing the board in the log
â›”- Valid board -> print in log -> NO CLUE ON HOW TO DO THIS

- Player can place his mark in a cell
   âœ” - ['','','','','','','','',''] -> Player X -> ['X','','','','','','','','']
   âœ” - ['','','','','','','','',''] -> Player O -> ['O','','','','','','','','']
   âœ” - ['','','','','','','','',''] -> Player X, cell 5 -> ['','','','','X','','','','']

- Player can only place his mark in an empty cell
   âœ” - ['X','','','','','','','',''] -> Player O, cell 1 -> false
   âœ” - ['','','O','','','','','',''] -> Player X, cell 3 -> false

- Players take turns
    ğŸ› - X -> O
    - O -> X
